###### C++ ASIO tutorials

The [tutorials](http://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.12.2/doc/asio/tutorial.html) 
for the *non-Boost* version of the 
[ASIO C++ networking library](http://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.12.2/doc/index.html)
 still use Boost constructs extensively (such as `boost::bind`).

 The otherwise excellent [Boost.Asio C++ Network Programming Cookbook](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781783986545)
 is, as its name implies, Boost-centric.
 
 These are my attempts at writing pure C++ versions of the ASIO tutorials and book examples as I 
 work my way through them.
